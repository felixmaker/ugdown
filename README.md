Yet another gui for you-get, lux, youtube-dl and more! Use it to scrapes the web at ease!

ToDo:

 - [ ] more readable code
 - [ ] add playlist
 - [ ] option(name, cookie...)
 - [ ] bug fix

This project is still under development. You can see the code in this repo now. The prebuilt release will be published as the most done!

You can talk about your ideas in issues!

Thank you!
